Welcome to CauliflowerPower!

The app designed to help you cook nutritious, wholesome, affordable food and reduce food waste. 

This project originated from a recipe book I wrote a couple of years ago title "Comida". The book contains 28 original recipes that are inexpensive, ingredient-flexible and mindful of a wide range of food preferences. Most recipes are gluten-free and all are nut free and vegan (with options to add non-vegan ingredients on the side).
Recipes are designed to be easily scalable in quantity and they preserve well if made ahead and refrigerated.

The app users are be able to select the fresh ingredients they have in their fridge and based on their selection they will have access to the book recipes that include any of those ingredients. Users are also able to purchase the Comida e-book. 

I hope you'll enjoy interacting with the app, have fun cooking this food, and find the recipes as delicious and I believe they are!

Bon Appetit,
-Elizabeth

Work in progress: 
- add a feature for users to add their favorite recipes to their account, 
- use ActiveStorage for users to upload the photos of the recipes they make and display them on the corresponding recipe page, 
- add the ability to download the e-book after purchase instead of receiving it via email, 
- improve styling.
